# NewsApp
There was a problem with the newsapi and I was not able to get the data from the api
I Googled it around and found that there is an issue with the newsapi and we need to host the api on our local machine
So I used some other api that I found on Stackoverflow to get the news.

Expect this everything is working absolutely fine
